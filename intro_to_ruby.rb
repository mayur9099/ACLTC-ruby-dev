#Create a brand new Ruby file that displays the result of some subtraction and run it from the terminal. 
#What happens if you subtract a greater number from a lesser number?
x=10
y=5
c=3
d=12
puts z=x-y
puts b=c-d
#Look at this code:
#PUTS 3 + 3
#Predict what exactly will happen when you run it. Then run it and see if you were correct.
puts 3+3
#Create another ruby file called many_ways.rb. You could get the number 10 to appear in the terminal (the output) by writing the code:
#puts 7 + 3
#Write code 3 more ways that will also output the number 10 in the terminal.
puts 7 + 3
puts 5+5
puts 8+2
puts 6+4
