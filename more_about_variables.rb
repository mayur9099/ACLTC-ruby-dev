#Analyze the following code, and keep a log that tracks what value x references during each line of code. For example, it can look#like this:
#Line 1: 3
#Line 2: 7
#Line 3: 2
#(etc. etc.)

x = 3                 #3

x = x + x             #4
x = x + x             #4
x = x * x             #4

#Can you guess what error youâ€™ll get if you run the code? Now run the code yourself. What error message do you get?
#DEBUG: Look at the following code:
#Fix the error by only changing line 3. The output should be 10.
