#Predict what happens when you run the following code:
#a = 1
#b = 2
#c = a + b
#d = c + a + b
#puts d

a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
d = c + a + b
puts d

#Answer -> 6


#Run the following code - you should see an error message. Fix the bug.
hello = "goodnight"
world = " moon"
puts hello + world
hello = "cat"
world = "fish"
puts hello + world
x = 1
y = 2
puts x + y

#solution -> #goodnight moon
#catfish
#3

#What does the following code do:
a = 1
b = a
puts b

#solution -> 1



#What does the following code do:
#a = 1
#b = a
#a = 2
#puts b
#Why do you think that is?

a = 1
b = a
a = 2
puts b

#solution -> 1
